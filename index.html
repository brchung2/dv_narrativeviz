        <h1>When have CO2 Emissions Decreased?</h1>
        <!-- paragraph text -->
        <p>
            Processes and technology that emit high amounts of greenhouse gases have become an insinuated fixture in our daily lives. 
            The food we eat, the way we commute to the office or grocery store, the endless array of new tech gadgets 
            that are always plugged in or charging, the amount of rubbish we produce that goes to landfill - these are all 
            seemingly innocuous daily events that contribute to carbon emissions. A typical U.S. household has a carbon 
            footprint of 48 metric tons CO2/yr. 
        </p>
         <p>
          This industrialization has been accompanied with climate change, resulting in more prevalent heat waves, wild fires, flash floods, 
           rising sea levels, drying up of historic bodies of water, and natural disasters. It is reported that the world is on the
           precipice of an irreversible tipping point in global warming. So how did we arrive at this precarious state, when were the 
           pivotal moments where global carbon emissions decreased, and what can we expect our future to look like?

          <h3>Growth in Global Emissions led by Europe, stagnant during the 1973 Oil Shock</h3>
          <p>
            Today's industrialized countries built their economies on burning fossil fuels to provide electricity, transport, and develop industries. 
            From the 1850's (further beyond this dataset), global carbon emissions experienced constant growth at a rate of 663M tons/year due to 
            industrialization and population growth led by Europe followed by North America and Asia. 
         </p>
          <p>
            In 1973, Arab countries that were major exporters of petroleum quadrupled the price of oil to almost $12/barrel. 
            The sudden surge of oil prices caused economic restructuring across the world, recessions, and political instability since oil 
            at the time was the main energy source for advanced economies like the US, Japan, and Western Europe.  This led 
            to a stagnation in global carbon emissions for 2 years at 17B tons.

          <h3>Emissions Growth Quickly Returns Followed by Similar Pause from 1979 Oil Shock 2</h3>
          <p>
            Global emissions returned at a similar rate of 685M tons/year, a 15% increase.
            Then another major oil crisis occurred in 1979 after a period of social unrest from the Iranian Revolution that damaged the 
            oil industry. This led to a decrease in oil output and oil consumption due to economies restructing away from depending on Iran oil supplies.
            Global carbon emissions fell by 3.2% decrease, with North America emissions dropping by 11%.

        <div id ="scene3" class="inactiveSlide">
          <h3>Emissions Growth Back on Track followed by 1990 Collapse of Soviet Union</h3>
          <p>
            Global emissions quickly jumped back, climbing to 634M tons/year.
            The Soviet Union collapse and the ensuing wave of democracy throughout Europe was accompanied with economic turmoil and 
            recessions in response to idealist visions of capitalism. Unemployment was at its highest, industries were stagnant leading to lower
            energy consumption. Europe's carbon emissions fell a whopping 30%, causing global emissions to fall 2.5%. Emissions actually started falling 
            right before the collapse resulting in a total drop of 5.3% between 1989-1994.

          <h3>1997 Asian Financial Crisis & the Start of the Turning Point </h3>
          <p>
            As economies were restructing away from burning
            fossil fuels, Europe's emissions surprisingly remained at 7B tons (and for the next 20 years). 
            This may have contributed to almost halving the normal global emissions rate to 380M tons/year. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The Asian financial crisis in 1997 resulted in a sequence of currency declines across many East Asian markets beginning the summer of 1997. 
            The currency markets first failed in Thailand reaching South Korea, and Japan. This led to a slow down in economic activity and 
            energy use, alleviating carbon emissions in East Asia by 5.2%, returning to levels before this downturn over the next four years. Global 
            emissions became roughly stagnant during this time, dropping by 0.6%.

          <h3>Emerging Markets Dominate Carbon Emissions with Brief Interruption from the 2009 Global Financial Crisis & Kyoto Protocol</h3>
            <p>
            The respite from the Asian Financial Crisis was quickly overshadowed by a huge surge in global emissions of 828M tons/year (24.6%) over eight years. 
             This largely reflected Asia emissions which increased at a rate of 613M tons/year and a total of 78% over eight years. Emissions were predominantly from China as the country was 
              categorized as one of the most dominant 
             emerging markets BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). 
             Emissions from Asia overtook both Europe and North America by a large margin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Great Recession in 2008 left millions unemployed across the world. As economies halted, global carbon emissions fell sharply by 
            480M tons (2.5%).
           </p>
         <p>
            At the same time, the Kyoto Protocol which was instated by 84 countries to legally mandate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions had its 
            first commitment period. Many countries were increasing energy efficiency and reducing CO2 intensity however, it 
            was reported that the financial crisis largely helped countries reduce carbon emissions.

          <h3> 2015 Paris Climate Agreement: The Start of the Fall? </h3>
          <p>
            The reduction in carbon emissions from the Global Financial Crisis was short lived. Strong emissions from the BRICS emerging economies, which 
            were not part of the Kyoto Protocol, contributed most to the global emissions rebounding by 
            1B tons/year in the following five years. Asia emissions continued to lead carbon emissions followed by Europe and North America.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2015, nearly 200 developed and developing countries committed to the Paris Climate Agreement requiring emission reduction to 
            curb global temperature increase. The following year, global emissions fell 220M tons (0.65%).
            The Paris pledge requires continual monitoring every 5 years, with the next summit upcoming on Nov 2021 where emissions are expected to be further clamped down.
           </p>
         <p>
           It is estimated that current global emissions have reduced by a further 2.4B tons due to the COVID-19 pandemic halting the economy and mandating
           lockdowns for the past 1.5 years. Furthermore, the drop in cost of renewable energy has driven coal out of the energy market, making energy-efficient options
           more readily available. With climate change being a top priority for world leaders and the shift of economies to greener alternatives, the goal and hope is that we can 
           reach net zero emissions by 2050.
