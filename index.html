        <h1>The Effect of Economic and Political Unrest on CO2 Emissions</h1>
        <!-- paragraph text -->
        <p>
            Processes and technology that emit high amounts of greenhouse gases have become an insinuated fixture in our daily lives. 
            The food we eat, the way we commute to the office or grocery store, the endless array of new tech gadgets 
            that are always plugged in or charging, the amount of rubbish we produce that goes to landfill - these are all 
            seemingly innocuous daily events that contribute to carbon emissions. A typical U.S. household has a carbon 
            footprint of 48 metric tons CO2/yr. 
        </p>
         <p>
          This industrialization has been accompanied with climate change, resulting in more prevalent heat waves, wild fires, flash floods, 
           rising sea levels, drying up of historic bodies of water, and natural disasters. It is reported that the world is on the
           precipice of an irreversible tipping point in global warming. So how did we arrive at this precarious state, when were the 
           pivotal moments where carbon emissions decreased, and what can we expect our future to look like?

          <h3>Global Emissions led by Europe, and the brief interruption from the 1973 Oil Shock</h3>
          <p>
            Today's industrialized countries built their economies on burning fossil fuels to provide electricity, transport, and develop industries. 
            From the 1850's to 1970's, carbon emissions experienced constant growth due to industrialization and population growth led by Europe followed 
            by North America and Asia. 
         </p>
          <p>
            In 1973, Arab countries that were major exporters of petroleum quadrupled the price of oil to almost $12/barrel. 
            The sudden surge of oil prices caused economic restructuring across the world, recessions, and political instability since oil 
            at the time was the main energy source for advanced economies like the US, Japan, and Western Europe.  This led 
            to a stagnation in global carbon emissions for 2 years at 17B tons, which was initially climbing at a rate of 750M tons/year entering the 1970's.

        <div id ="slideTwo" class="inactiveSlide">
          <h3>1979 Oil Shock 2</h3>
          <p>
            Another major oil crisis occurred in 1979 after a period of social unrest from the Iranian Revolution that damaged the 
            oil industry. This led to a decrease in oil output and oil consumption due to economies restructing away from depending on Iran oil supplies.
            This resulted in a 3.2% decrease in global carbon emissions, with North America emissions dropping 6.8%.

          <h3>1990 Collapse of Soviet Union</h3>
          <p>
            The Soviet Union collapse and the ensuing wave of democracy throughout Europe was accompanied with economic turmoil and 
            recessions in response to idealist visions of capitalism. Unemployment was at its highest, industries were stagnant leading to lower
            energy consumption. Europe's carbon emissions fell a whopping 33%, causing global emissions to fall 6.8%. As economies were restructing away from burning
            fossil fuels, Europe's emissions surprisingly remained at 7B tons for the next 20 years.

          <h3>1997 Asian Financial Crisis & the Start of the Turning Point </h3>
          <p>
            The Asian financial crisis resulted in a sequence of currency declines across many East Asian markets beginning the summer of 1997. 
            The currency markets first failed in Thailand reaching South Korea, and Japan. This led to a slow down in economic activity and 
            energy use, which decreased carbon emissions in East Asia by 9.3%, returning to levels before this downturn in 4 years. Global 
            emissions was increasing at 42M tons/year until it became stagnant during this time.

          <h3>Emerging Markets dominate carbon emissions following the 2009 Global Financial Crisis & Kyoto Protocol</h3>
            <p>
            The respite from the Asian Financial Crisis was quickly overshadowed by a huge surge in global emissions of 8.6M tons/year (24.6%) over seven years. 
             This largely reflected Asia emissions which increased at a rate of 6.7M tons/year (9.4%), predominantly from China as the country was 
              categorized as one of the most dominant 
             emerging markets BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). 
             Emissions from Asia overtook both Europe and North America.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Great Recession in 2008 left millions unemployed across the world. As economies halted, global carbon emissions fell sharply by 
            480 million tons (2.5%).
           </p>
         <p>
            In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was instated by 84 countries to legally mandate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the 
            first commitment period of 2008-2012. Many countries were increasing energy efficiency and reducing CO2 intensity however, it 
            is reported that the financial crisis largely helped countries reduce carbon emissions.

          <h3> 2015 Paris Climate Agreement: The Start of the Fall? </h3>
          <p>
            The reduction in carbon emissions from the Global Financial Crisis was short lived. Strong emissions from the BRICS emerging economies 
           (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), which were not part of the Kyoto Protocol, contributed to the global emissions rebounding by 
            almost 1B tons/year in the following five years. Asia emissions has continued to lead carbon emissions followed by Europe and North America.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nearly 200 developed and developing countries committed to the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 requiring emission reduction to 
            curb global temperature increase. The following year, global emissions fell 2.2M tons.
            The pledge requires continual monitoring every 5 years, with the next summit upcoming on Nov 2021 expected to establish goals that
            further clamp down on emissions.
           </p>
         <p>
           It is estimated that current global emissions have reduced by a further 2.4B tons due to the COVID-19 pandemic halting the economy and instantiating
           lockdowns for the past 1.5 years. Furthermore, the drop in cost of renewable energy has driven coal out of energy market, making energy-efficient options
           more readily available. With climate change being a prioritized crisis and the shift of economies into greener alternatives, the goal and hope is that we can 
           reach net zero emissions by 2050.
